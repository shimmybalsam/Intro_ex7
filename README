I discussed the exercise with:
Gali Lustig and Lab Support.

=============================
= README for ex7: ex7.py
=============================

===========================
=  Description: =

One program containing many different functions which are built so that each
one/two/three function/s are made to solve a the following problems in a
recursive manner:
- Printing all the numbers from a 1 until a given number, both in an ascending
and descending order.
- Returning the boolean value of if a given number is prime or not.
- Returning a list of all the positive divisors of a given number.
- Returning the exponential sum of a given number, from 0 until a given value.
- Moving a given number of hoops from a starting pole to a destined pole
 (Hanoi Towers game).
- Printing all the possible binary sequences of a given length.
- Printing all the possible sequences made out of given characters and of a
  given length, both with repetition of letter and without, and returning a
  list of all said sequences with no repetitions.

====================================================

==========================================
= Special Comments =

In the divisors function you specifically asked to return the list in an
ascending order but as an example you showed a list in a descending order:
[12 ,6 ,4 ,3 ,2 ,1]

This was very confusing once checking the testers, seeing that originally i
built my function to fit your example, and had to rewrite it completely once i
realized your example was false. I'm sure I wasn't the only one.
Please pay more attention in further assignments, and save us all unneeded
extra aggravation.
Thank you
